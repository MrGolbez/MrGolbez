# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in understanding rule and index creation using Wazuh. 
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of SIEM configuration and navigation.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Configuration of Sysmon for log ingestion into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
- 

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis with Wazuh.
- Security Operation Center Case Management and SOAR workflow using TheHive and Shuffler.io workflow.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
