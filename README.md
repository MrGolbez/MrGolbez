Skilled in leveraging industry-leading tools such as Splunk ES, CrowdStrike Falcon, and SentinelOne to monitor, analyze, and remediate security incidents efficiently. Proficient in threat hunting, log analysis, and phishing mitigation, with expertise in frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, and OWASP Top 10. 

I spend my weekends pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity at CSU Dominguez Hills, where I continue to expand and refine my technical and leadership abilities through academic excellence and hands-on projects. As President of the CSUDH Cyber Security Club, I’ve organized student-led conferences, hackathons, and workshops, empowering others to gain practical cybersecurity skills. I am committed to continuous learning and making a meaningful impact in protecting organizations from evolving cyber threats. I am open to opportunities to contribute to security initiatives, strengthen defenses, and grow as a cybersecurity professional.

## Objective

Passionate and results-driven Cybersecurity Analyst with hands-on experience in SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. Skilled in SIEM analysis, endpoint security, vulnerability management, and security automation, with expertise in tools such as Splunk ES, IBM QRadar, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne. Strong understanding of cyber defense frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, OWASP Top 10) and risk mitigation strategies.

My goal is to build a career in Security Operations, applying my technical expertise to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, with the long-term objective of growing into a Cybersecurity Engineer role, where I can design and implement proactive security solutions, enhance detection capabilities, and contribute to a stronger cybersecurity posture.
